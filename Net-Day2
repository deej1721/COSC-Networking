CTFD CHALLENGES - Networking - 1 - Fundamentals 
Gorgas Network Validation (GNV)
XX OCT 2023
Start Time: ~1300
Duration: 4 hour
Type of Operation: Network & Protocol familiarization, Custom Packet Creation & Manipulation
Objective: Identify and Validate the methods of encapsulation, header manipulation, packet traversal, and header structure in order to assist Gorgan Cyber Forces. 
Craft Custom ARP Requests and obfuscated ICMPv6 packets to enable Gorgas Cyber Forces to perform effective host discovery and Manipulation. 
You will use scapy and leverage ARP functions to manually "discover" your windows host, as a valid test case to provide to their cyber forces. 
You will use scapy and leverage IPv6 auto configuration functions to create a means of IPv6 direct communications between the Linux and Windows Machine.
