NETWORK MAPPING NOTES:
  UTILIZE FOLLOWING AXII: 
  ----------------------
     *   ACTIVE  *
  EXTERNAL * INTERNAL
     *  PASSIVE  *
  ----------------------
  MOVE FROM EXERNAL, PASSIVE (RESOLVE IP AND FQDN) -> EXTERNAL, ACTIVE (GAIN ACCESS TO BOX)-> INTERNAL, PASSIVE (CONDUCT INTERNAL NETWORK SITUATIONAL AWARENESS) -> INTERNAL, ACTIVE (MONEYSHOT)
  EXTERNAL, PASSIVE: JOB SITE LISTINGS, WEB RECON, WHOIS LISTING, DNS QUERIES, GOOGLE SEARCHES, SHODAN, ZONE TRANSFERS
  EXTERNAL, ACTIVE: nmap AND ping SCANS
  INTERNAL, PASSIVE: OPEN PORTS, RUNNING SERVICES, OTHER USERS, ARP CACHE, INTERFACE IPs, KNOWN ROUTES, PACKET SNIFFERS, CHECKING /etc/hosts AND/OR /etc/resolv.conf
  INTERNAL, ACTIVE: DNS QUERIES, PING SWEEP/ARP REQUESTS
ENUMERATION DEMO:
  whois <FQDN> REVEALS SIGNIFICANT INFO ON THAT FQDN: NAME SERVERS
  dig <FQDN> REVEALS RECORDS: A = IPV4, AAAA = IPV6, MX = MAIL SERVER, PTR = REVERSE DNS RECORDS, SOA = START OF AUTHORITY
  dig axfr nsztm1.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me CONDUCTS ZONE TRANSFER AGAINST NAME SERVER nsztm1.digi.ninja
  SCANNING STRATEGIES: REMOTE -> LOCAL, LOCAL -> REMOTE, LOCAL -> LOCAL, REMOTE -> REMOTE
  nmap -A -T4 --min-rate 10000 -Pn <TARGET-HOST> -vvvv (CAN USE FQDNS)
  FILTERED ONLY: nmap -Pn <NETWORK> -p 21-23,80 | egrep -v filtered
  OPEN ONLY: nmap -Pn <NETWORK> -p 21-23,80 | egrep -v "open"
  !!!FOR THIS CLASS: UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED OR HINTED, ALL MACHINES WILL HAVE AT LEAST 21,22,23, OR 80 OPEN!!!
  CTRL SHIFT C, CTRL SHIFT V TO COPY PASTE IN VIM
  netstat -ntulp GRANTS NUMERICAL PORT, TCP/UDP, LISTENING STATE, WHAT PROCESS HAS THAT PORT OPEN, HOWEV(ER, netstat IS DEPRICATED, ss
  cat /etc/hostd AND /etc/resolv.conf FOR RELEVANT INFO
  ip a = NEW ifconfigg (DISPLAY INTERNAL IPs)
  ip n = NEW arp -a (DISPLAY ARP CACHE)
  ip r = NEW route (DISPLAY ROUTES TO OTHER NETWORKS)for i in {1..254} ; do (pint -c 1 <NETWORK>.$i | grep "bytes from" &) ;done
  0.0.0.0 EQUIVALENT TO ASTERISK - BOUND TO ALL INTERFACES!
  6010,6011,6012 = X11 FORWARDING PORTS
  ssh vyos@172.16.20.1 - SSH ONTO ROUTER (ALWAYS USE vyos AS USERNAME FOR THIS COURSE WHEN SSHING ONTO ROUTER)
   = PING SWEEP
  nmap -Pn
  ON VYOS ROUTER: show config TO DISPLAY ENTIRE ROUTER CONFIG
  ON VYOS ROUTER: show interface TO DISPLAY ONLY ROUTER INTERFACES, MORE GENERALLY USEFUL THAN ABOVE
  NETCAT BANNER GRAB SYNTAX: nc -<IP> <PORT> 
  WGET BANNER GRAB SYNTAX: wget -r localhost (-r FOR RECURSIVE, ALWAYS HELPFUL!)
  wget -r ftp://localhost FTPs TO SPECIFIED HOST
  curl localhost GRABS URL REQUEST

CTFD CHALLENGES - Networking - 3 - Network Reconnaissance
Network Reconnaissance â€“ START
Donovian Mapping & Reconnaissance (DMR)
XX OCT 2023
Start Time: 1300
Duration: 4 hours

Type of Operation: Scanning & Reconnaissance

Objective: In an effort to aid Gorgas Cyber forces, you have been tasked to assist with an overall collection and analysis of data from Donovian Cyberspace and their networks. You are tasked to perform various types of reconnaissance to accomplish this. The Gorgan Active Recon cell gained access to a boundary router and gathered the following intelligence belonging to deployed Donovian forces but have not been able to put together any mapping of their overall infrastructure. Aid the efforts by building a map of the entire network including networking devices and the target host machines below with:

Gathered Intelligence: Credentials
student:password
vyos:password

The regional COCOM has provided direction to build a network map providing the following details, in order to drive future cyberspace operations:
Device type
Hostname
Interface type
Interface IP
Subnet Mask CIDR
Autonomous system number, Routing Protocol, IP network and Network Name groupings
Open ports
Operating system type and versions
Tools/Techniques: dig, nmap, nc, /dev/tcp
Scenario Credentials: Perform DNS recon on your ctfd server to obtain the start flag.
The start flag is an encoded string that is in a record associated with your CTFd server. Decode this string for the flag
Prior Approvals: You will use SSH to progress through the network but all scanning should be conducted from your INTERNET_HOST
Scheme of Maneuver:
>INTERNET_HOST
-> Red Boundry Router: DONOVIAN CYBERSPACE
Target Section:
T1
Hostname: networking-ctfd-2.server.vta
Record Type: TXT

Ports: 53
Action: interrogate DNS records
Red Boundry Router
Hostname:
IP: 172.16.120.1
Ports: 22
Username: vyos
Password: password
Action: Use as start point and Perform Passive/Active Reconnaissance
T2
Hostname: UNKNOWN
IP: 172.16.182.110
Action: Perform Active Reconnaissance
T3
Hostname: UNKNOWN
IP: 172.16.140.33
